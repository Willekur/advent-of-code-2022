# Advent of Code 2022

This is my implementation of the Advent of Code. I've used Python to solve the
puzzles.

My implentations are based on Python 3. Some where developed on Python 3.9.6
while some others only run on Python 3.10.8 (due to the use of match
statements). The solutions are with minimal use of libraries.
